# Project State

## Project Reference

**Core value:** Accurate, instant stack display during combat
**Current focus:** Phase 0 complete — ready for Phase 1

## Current Position

Phase: 0 of 5 (Repo Cleanup)
Plan: 1 of 1 in current phase (COMPLETE)
Status: Phase 0 complete
Last activity: 2026-06-17 -- Phase 0 plan 1 executed

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 2min
- Total execution time: 2min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 0 - Repo Cleanup | 1 | 2min | 2min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 00-01 (2min)
- Trend: N/A (first plan)

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Use busted 2.3.0 with `--lua-version=5.1` — installing without flag produces Lua 5.4 binary where `setfenv` is unavailable
- [Init]: Extract Util.lua before writing any tests — prerequisite for clean `dofile`-based test loading
- [Init]: QUAL-03 (dead migration fallback removal) deferred to Phase 3 — requires NormalizeDB idempotency test to be in place first
- [Revision]: Phase 0 (Repo Cleanup) inserted — covers CLN-01 through CLN-05, executes before all other phases

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **[Research flag — Phase 2]**: busted Lua 5.1 installation requires `--lua-version=5.1` at LuaRocks install time; mock accuracy must be reviewed against warcraft.wiki.gg before writing any test (hard gate, not follow-up)
- **[Research flag — Phase 4]**: `C_Spell.GetSpellTexture` two-return-value behavior under patch 12.0.5 not explicitly confirmed in STACK.md — verify against warcraft.wiki.gg before implementing texture caching

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward:

| v2 | MOD-01: Pack Leader beast tracking | Deferred | Init |
| v2 | MOD-02: Per-module options section convention | Deferred | Init |
